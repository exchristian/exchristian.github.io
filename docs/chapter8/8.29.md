# 如何评价“没有信仰的中国人很可怕”？

我特意去Quora 查了下类似的问题。

因为这篇文章刻意抹黑中国人，多半是个崇洋媚外的货。

我就用老外的回答抚摸他的脸，正面抚摸。



问：Are most people who commit crimes atheists?

那些犯罪的大多数都是无神论者吧？


答：This question seems to be based on the misconception that atheists have no morals because they don’t believe in any god. That’s basically a lie told by priests to demonize atheists and try to keep believers from getting in contact with atheistic ideas, i.e. reasons for not believing. Morals can come from religions, but they also can come from culture or simply empathy and reason.

这个问题是基于“无神论者没有道德”的误解，基本出于牧师之口，目的是妖魔化无神论者，防止信徒接触无神论的观点。

道德可能来自宗教，也可能来自文化，或者同情，或者理性。(2.3k赞)


问：What guides atheists to be good and stops them from doing evil since they don't believe that hell is real?

无神论者不相信地狱存在，那什么东西促使他们行善避恶呢？


答：This question has been asked and answered so many times here at Quora, that folks who ask the question NOW are unwittingly convincing me that the religious folk among us are incapable of reading or learning.

这个问题在Quora上被问了无数次了，那些一直问这种问题的人让我相信宗教信徒们多是些没有学习和阅读能力的货。

Well, thankfully, I have a brain. Through millions of years of evolution, the human brain developed chemicals that are released from birth forward that assist us in forming social bonds so that we will care for each other and our offspring. These bonds are strengthened over time through education and social interaction.

我有大脑啊，百万年的进化让我们形成了社会依赖（bond），所以我们会彼此照顾。这种社会依赖通过教育与互动不断地加强。

……（这里是数据实锤）

From statistics alone, it appears the religious have the moral problem, not atheist.

单从数据来看，貌似道德方面有毛病的正是信徒，而不是无神论者。（854赞）


从Quora和知乎的情况来看，天下乌鸦一般黑，天下信徒一样stupid。

这才是（某些）信徒们恐怖的地方，无论在什么地方，他们总是要不遗余力地妖魔化无神论者。
